# Jump The Flag
# A Kangaroo, is trying to reach a flag that's flagHeight units above the ground.
# In his attempt to reach the flag, the kangaroo can make any number of jumps up the rock wall where it's mounted;
# however, he can only move up the wall (meaning he cannot overshoot the flag and move down to reach it).
# There are 2 types of jumps:
#   1.) A jump of height 1.
#   2.) A jump of height jumpHeight.

# the kangaroo wants your help determining the minimum number of jumps it will take him to collect the flag.
# Complete the jumps function. It has 2 parameters:
# An integer, flagHeight, the height of the flag.
# An integer, jumpHeight, the number of units he ascends in a jump of type 2.
# It must return an integer denoting the minimum number of times the kangaroo must jump to collect the flag.

# Example:
# flagHeight = 3, jumpHeight = 1
# Should return 3
# As the kangaroo can only jump 1 unit or jumpHeight units and jumpHeight = 1, the kangaroo can only ever make 1-unit jumps.
# This means that it will take him 3 steps to reach the flag, so we return 3.
